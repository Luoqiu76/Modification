In the following 20 years he wrote 26 books, many of which are among the very best of English literature, and some of which are still in print.Marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories. He says somewhere that when he sat down for the day's work, he never knew what he was going to write. He certainly was a literary genius.PERCIVAL KEENE\n\nBY CAPTAIN FREDERICK MARRYAT\n\nCHAPTER ONE.A few miles from the town of Southampton there is an old mansion-house, which has been for centuries known as Madeline Hall, in the possession of the de Versely family. It is a handsome building, surrounded by a finely timbered park of some extent, and, what is more important, by about 12,000 acres of land, which also appertain to it. At the period in which I commence this history, there resided in this mansion an elderly spinster of rank, named the Honourable Miss Delmar, sister ofthe late Lord de Versely and aunt to the present earl, and an Honourable Captain Delmar, who was the second son of the deceased nobleman. This property belonged to the Honourable Miss Delmar, and was at her entire disposal upon her decease.The Honourable Captain Delmar, at the time I am speaking of, commanded a frigate employed upon what was designated channel service, which in those days implied that the captain held a seat in the House of Commons and that he voted with the ministry; and further, that his vote might, when required, be forthcoming, the frigate was never sea-going, except during the recess. It must be admitted that H.M. ship Paragon did occasionally get under weigh and remain cruising in sight of land for.two or three days, until the steward reported that the milk provided for the captain's table was turning sour; upon which important information the helm was immediately put up, and the frigate, in a case of such extreme distress, would drop her anchor at the nearest port under her lee. Now as the Paragon was constantly at Spithead, Captain Delmar was very attentive in visiting his aunt, who lived at Madeline Hall; ill-natured people asserted, because she had so fine an estate in her.Certain it is, that he would remain there for weeks, which gave great satisfaction to the old lady, who liked her nephew, liked attention, and was even so peculiar as to like sailors. But it must be observed that there was another person at the mansion who also liked the captain, liked attention, and liked sailors; this was Miss Arabella Mason, a very pretty young woman of eighteen years of age, who constantly looked in the glass merely to ascertain if she had ever seena face which she preferred to her own, and who never read any novel without discovering that there was a remarkable likeness between the heroine and her pretty self.Miss Arabella Mason was the eldest daughter of the steward of the old Lord de Versely, brother to the Honourable Miss Delmar, and was much respected by his lordship for his fidelity and his knowledge of business. He fell while felling trees, and a tree fell upon him. He left a widow and two daughters: it was said that at his death Mrs Mason was not badly off, as her husband had been very careful of his earnings. Mrs Mason, however, did notThe Honourable Miss Delmar, after Lord de Versely's death, sent both the daughters to be educated at a country school, where, as everything that is taught is second-rate, young ladies, of course, receive a second-rate education. Mrs Mason was often invited by the Honourable Miss Delmar to spend a month at Madeline Hall, and used to bring her eldest.daughter, who had left school, with her. Latterly, however, the daughter remained as a fixture, and Mrs Mason received but an occasional invitation. It may be inquired in what capacity Miss Arabella Mason remained at the Hall; she was not a servant, for her position in life was above that of a menial; neither was she received altogether in the saloon, as she was of too humble a grade to mix with gentry and nobility; she was, therefore, betwixt and between, a sort ofhumble companion in the drawing-room, a cut above the housekeeper in the still-room, a fetcher and carrier of the honourable spinster's wishes, a sort of link between the aristocratic old dame and her male attendants, towards whom she had a sort of old maidish aversion. However this position might be found useful to her mistress, it must be admitted that it was a most unfortunate position for a young, thoughtless, and very pretty girl, moreover, who was naturally very lively, very smart inrepartee, and very fond of being admired.As the Honourable Captain Delmar was very constant in his visits to his aunt, it was but natural that he should pay some little attention to her humble companion. By degrees the intimacy increased, and at last there were reports in the servants' hall that the captain and Miss Bella Mason had been seen together in the evergreen walk; and as the captain's visits were continually repeated during the space of two years so did the scandal increase, and people became more ill-natured. It was nowseen that Miss Bella had been very often found in tears, and the old butler and the older housekeeper shook their heads at each other like responsive mandarins; the only person who was ignorant of the scandal afloat was the old lady spinster herself.The Honourable Captain Delmar did not, of course, travel without his valet, and this important personage had been selected out of the marine corps which had been drafted into the frigate. Benjamin Keene, for such was his name, was certainly endowed with several qualities which were indispensable in a valet; he was very clean in his person, very respectful in his deportment, and, after the sovereign of Great Britain, looked upon theHonourable Captain Delmar as the greatest person in the world. Moreover, Benjamin Keene, although only a private marine was, without exception, one of the handsomest men that ever was seen and being equally as well made and well drilled as he was handsome in person, he was the admiration of all the young women. But Nature, who delights in a drawback, had contrived to leave him almost without brains; and further, he was wholly uneducated--for he was too stupid to learn--hisfaculties were just sufficient to enable him, by constant drilling, to be perfect in the manual exercise, and mechanically to perform his duties as a valet.Ben always accompanied his master to the hall, where the former was at one and the same time the admiration and laughter of all the servants. It hardly need be observed that the clever and sprightly Miss Arabella Mason considered Ben as one much beneath her; that is, she said so on his first arrival at Madeline hall. But, strange to say, that two years afterwards, just at the time that reports had been raised that she had been frequently discovered in tears, there was a change in her manner.towards him; indeed some people insinuated that she was setting her cap at the handsome marine: this idea, it is true, was ridiculed by the majority; but still the intimacy appeared rapidly to increase. It was afterwards asserted by those who find out everything after it has taken place, that Ben would never have ventured to look up to such an unequal match had he not been prompted to it by his master, who actually proposed that he should marry the girl. That such was the fact isundoubted, although they knew it not; and Ben, who considered the wish of his captain as tantamount to an order, as soon as he could comprehend what his captain required of him, stood up erect and raised his hand with a flourish to his head, in token of his obedience. Shortly afterwards, Captain Delmar again came over to Madeline Hall, accompanied as usual, by Ben, and the second day after their arrival it was made known to all whom it might concern, that Miss Arabella Mason hadactually contracted a secret marriage with the handsome Benjamin Keene.",

        "edit_suggestion": "Instead of Miss Arabella Mason being a superficial character focused on her beauty and desirability, reshape her personality to be fiercely intelligent and ambitious, aspiring to become a renowned writer. Her affections for Captain Delmar can be framed as a tactical alliance, using her charm to gain access to the literary circles he frequents. This change creates tension as her ambition conflicts with the scandal surrounding her secret marriage to Benjamin Keene, which she must navigate while trying to maintain her aspirations and reputation in a society that views women primarily as wives and daughters.",

        "clean_text": "Five weeks in a balloon, or, Journeys and discoveries in Africa by three Englishmen. The story begins with Dr. Ferguson, an adventurous physician with a love for exploration. He gathers a small group of companions, including the skilled balloonist, Mr. Kennedy, and the knowledgeable servant, Joe. They plan a daring journey across the African continent in a balloon.\n\nAs they launch into the sky, the trio is captivated by the vast landscapes below them. They fly over lush forests, sprawling deserts, and the majestic mountains of Africa. Along the way, they encounter various wildlife and remarkable natural phenomena, which heighten their sense of adventure. The challenges they face from storms and unexpected wildlife encounters only add to the excitement of their journey.\n\nThroughout their voyage, they become increasingly aware of the mysteries of the African continent. Dr. Ferguson's scientific curiosity drives them to observe and document everything they see, from the geography to the fauna. Teamwork and trust among the group are essential as they navigate the unpredictable elements of flight and exploration.\n\nIn their quest, they meet diverse tribes, learn about different cultures, and partake in unique experiences that expand their understanding of humanity. Each interaction reveals more about the land and its people, creating a tapestry of stories woven into their journey.\n\nAs the weeks progress, the balloonists grow closer, forging bonds that transcend their initial acquaintanceship. They reflect on their motivations for the journey, discovering not just landscapes but also the depths of friendship and adventure.\n\nTheir five-week expedition comes to a thrilling conclusion, leaving them forever changed by the vastness of Africa and the treasures of knowledge they have gathered. The journey not only fulfills their desire for discovery but also instills a deeper appreciation for the world and each other.Five Weeks in a Balloon is, in a measure, a satire on modern books of African travel. So far as the geography, the inhabitants, the animals, and the features of the countries the travellers pass over are described, it is entirely accurate. It gives, in some particulars, a survey of nearly the whole field of African discovery, and in this way will often serve to refresh the memory of the reader. The mode of locomotion is, of course, purely imaginary, and the incidents andadventures fictitious. The latter are abundantly amusing, and, in view of the wonderful \"travellers' tales\" with which we have been entertained by African explorers, they can scarcely be considered extravagant; while the ingenuity and invention of the author will be sure to excite the surprise and the admiration of the reader, who will find M.

As they journey across Africa, he becomes increasingly aware of the impact their expedition has on the local tribes and begins to question the ethics of their adventure, fostering discussions among the group about their role as explorers in a land that is not theirs to claim. This shift raises the stakes of their journey, adding tension to their interactions with native cultures and forcing Ferguson to confront whether their discoveries are worth the potential harm inflicted on those he encounters.",

Howard\n\nRelease Date: February 24, 2013 [EBook #42188]\n\nLanguage: EnglishShadows in the Moonlight\n\nBy Robert E. Howard\n\nThe moon hung high in the darkness, casting eerie shadows across the landscape. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the distant sound of rustling leaves. It was a night like no other, where the secrets of the world seemed to come alive.\n\nAmidst the shadows, a figure moved silently, her presence barely disturbing the tranquil night. She was a woman of fierce determination, her heart beating in time with the pulse of the wilderness around her. The moonlight danced upon her features, revealing a strong jaw and eyes that sparkled with defiance.\n\nShe had come seeking answers, drawn by the whisper of ancient tales that spoke of hidden treasures and lost civilizations. The path was fraught with danger, yet the thrill of adventure urged her onward. Each step resonated with a promise of discovery, propelling her into the depths of the unknown.\n\nAs she ventured deeper into the forest, the shadows grew thicker, wrapping around her like a shroud. The night was alive with the sounds of creatures scuttling through the underbrush, their movements echoing in the silence. Yet, undeterred, she pressed on, fueled by an insatiable curiosity.\n\nWith every footfall, she felt the weight of the past pressing upon her, urging her to uncover the truth that lay hidden in the depths of the night. Each rustle, each sigh of the wind seemed to carry a message meant just for her. The moon watched over her, a silent guardian illuminating the path ahead.\n\nIn that moment, the world was hers for the taking, a vast expanse of mystery inviting her to unravel its secrets. The adventure awaited, and she was ready to embrace it, come what may.A swift crashing of horses through the tall reeds; a heavy fall, a despairing cry. From the dying steed there staggered up its rider, a slender girl in sandals and girdled tunic. Her dark hair fell over her white shoulders, her eyes were those of a trapped animal. She did not look at the jungle of reeds that hemmed in the little clearing, nor at the blue waters that lapped the low shore behind her. Her wide-eyed gaze was fixed in agonized intensity on the horseman who pushed through the.reedy screen and dismounted before her.He was a tall man, slender, but hard as steel. From head to heel he was clad in light silvered mesh-mail that fitted his supple form like a glove. From under the dome-shaped, gold-chased helmet his brown eyes regarded her mockingly.\n\n'Stand back!' her voice shrilled with terror. 'Touch me not, Shah Amurath, or I will throw myself into the water and drown!'\n\nHe laughed, and his laughter was like the purr of a sword sliding from a silken sheath.No, you will not drown, Olivia, daughter of confusion, for the marge is too shallow, and I can catch you before you can reach the deeps. You gave me a merry chase, by the gods, and all my men are far behind us. But there is no horse west of Vilayet that can distance Irem for long. He nodded at the tall, slender-legged desert stallion behind him.'Let me go!' begged the girl, tears of despair staining her face. 'Have I not suffered enough? Is there any humiliation, pain or degradation you have not heaped on me? How long must my torment last?''As long as I find pleasure in your whimperings, your pleas, tears and writhe, you are strangely virile, Olivia. I wonder if I shall ever weary of you, as I have always wearied of women before. You are ever fresh and unsullied, in spite of me. Each new day with you brings a new delight.'But come—let us return to Akif, where the people are still feting the conqueror of the miserable kozaki; while he, the conqueror, is engaged in recapturing a wretched fugitive, a foolish, lovely, idiotic runaway!\n\nNo! She recoiled, turning toward the waters lapping bluely among the reeds.'Yes!' His flash of open anger was like a spark struck from flint. With a quickness her tender limbs could not approximate, he caught her wrist, twisting it in pure wanton cruelty until she screamed and sank to her knees.\n\n'Slut! I should drag you back to Akif at my horse's tail, but I will be merciful and carry you on my saddle-bow, for which favor you shall humbly thank me, while--'He released her with a startled oath and sprang back, his saber flashing out, as a terrible apparition burst from the reedy jungle sounding an inarticulate cry of hate.Olivia, staring up from the ground, saw what she took to be either a savage or a madman advancing on Shah Amurath in an attitude of deadly menace. He was powerfully built, naked but for a girdled loincloth, which was stained with blood and crusted with dried mire. His black mane was matted with mud and clotted blood; there were streaks of dried blood on his chest and limbs, dried blood on the long straight sword he gripped in his right hand. From under the tangle of his locks, bloodshot.eyes glared like coals of blue fire.'You Hyrkanian dog!' mouthed this apparition in a barbarous accent. 'The devils of vengeance have brought you here!'\n\n'_Kozak!_' ejaculated Shah Amurath, recoiling. 'I did not know a dog of you escaped! I thought you all lay stiff on the steppe, by Ilbars River.''All but me, damn you!' cried the other. 'Oh, I've dreamed of such a meeting as this, while I crawled on my belly through the brambles, or lay under rocks while the ants gnawed my flesh, or crouched in the mire up to my mouth--I dreamed, but never hoped it would come to pass. Oh, gods of Hell, how I have yearned for this!'\n\nThe stranger's bloodthirsty joy was terrible to behold. His jaws champed spasmodically, froth appeared on his blackened lips.\n\n'Keep back!' ordered Shah Amurath, watching him narrowly.'Ha!' It was like the bark of a timber wolf. 'Shah Amurath, the great Lord of Akif! Oh, damn you, how I love the sight of you--you, who fed my comrades to the vultures, who tore them between wild horses, blinded and maimed and mutilated them--ai, you dog, you filthy dog!' His voice rose to a maddened scream, and he charged.In spite of the terror of his wild appearance, Olivia looked to see him fall at the first crossing of the blades. Madman or savage, what could he do, naked, against the mailed chief of Akif?There was an instant when the blades flamed and licked, seeming barely to touch each other and leap apart; then the broadsword flashed past the saber and descended terrifically on Shah Amurath's shoulder. Olivia cried out at the fury of that stroke. Above the crunch of the rending mail, she distinctly heard the snap of the shoulder-bone. The Hyrkanian reeled back, suddenly ashen, blood spurting over the links of his hauberk; his saber slipped from his nerveless fingers.\n\n'Quarter!' he gasped.'Quarter?' There was a quiver of frenzy in the stranger's voice. 'Quarter such as you gave us, you swine!'Olivia closed her eyes. This was no longer battle, but butchery, frantic, bloody, impelled by a hysteria of fury and hate, in which culminated the sufferings of battle, massacre, torture, and fear-ridden, thirst-maddened, hunger-haunted flight. Though Olivia knew that Shah Amurath deserved no mercy or pity from any living creature, yet she closed her eyes and pressed her hands over her ears, to shut out the sight of that dripping sword that rose and fell with the sound of abutcher's cleaver, and the gurgling cries that dwindled away and ceased.She opened her eyes, to see the stranger turning away from a gory travesty that only vaguely resembled a human being. The man's breast heaved with exhaustion or passion; his brow was beaded with sweat; his right hand was splashed with blood.He did not speak to her, or even glance toward her. She saw him stride through the reeds that grew at the water's edge, stoop, and tug at something. A boat wallowed out of its hiding-place among the stalks. Then she divined his intention, and was galvanized into action.\n\n'Oh, wait!' she wailed, staggering up and running toward him. 'Do not leave me! Take me with you!'He wheeled and stared at her. There was a difference in his bearing. His bloodshot eyes were sane. It was as if the blood he had just shed had quenched the fire of his frenzy.\n\n'Who are you?' he demanded.\n\n'I am called Olivia. I was his captive. I ran away. He followed me. That's why he came here. Oh, do not leave me here! His warriors are not far behind him. They will find his corpse--they will find me near it--oh!' She moaned in her terror and wrung her white hands.\n\nHe stared at her in perplexity.",

        "edit_suggestion": "Change the character of Shah Amurath from a cruel captor to a conflicted anti-hero who is reluctantly pursuing Olivia not out of malice, but because he feels a sense of duty to reclaim her. As he confronts her in the reeds, allow him to express fleeting moments of regret for the harm he’s caused and a hint of admiration for her courage. This shift will add complexity to his character and create a moral gray area, leading to a climactic moment where he ultimately decides to protect her from the savage attacker, showcasing an unexpected bond formed in adversity.",

For the first time in history it is possible for everyone to view the entire planet, with all its myriad.diversified peoples, in one perspective. World peace is not only possible but inevitable. It is the next stage in the evolution of this planet—in the words of one great thinker, “the planetization of mankind.”Whether peace is to be reached only after unimaginable horrors precipitated by humanity’s stubborn clinging to old patterns of behaviour, or is to be embraced now by an act of consultative will, is the choice before all who inhabit the earth. At this critical juncture when the intractable problems confronting nations have been fused into one common concern for the whole world, failure to stem the tide of conflict and disorder would be unconscionably irresponsible.Among the favourable signs are the steadily growing strength of the steps towards world order taken initially near the beginning of this century in the creation of the League of Nations, succeeded by the more broadly based United Nations Organization; the achievement since the Second World War of independence by the majority of all the nations on earth, indicating the completion of the process of nation building, and the involvement of these.fledgling nations with older ones in matters of mutual concern; the consequent vast increase in co-operation among hitherto isolated and antagonistic peoples and groups in international undertakings in the scientific, educational, legal, economic and cultural fields; the rise in recent decades of an unprecedented number of international humanitarian organizations; the spread of women’s and youth movements calling for an end to war; and the spontaneous spawning of widening networks of ordinarypeople seeking understanding through personal communication.The scientific and technological advances occurring in this unusually blessed century portend a great surge forward in the social evolution of the planet, and indicate the means by which the practical problems of humanity may be solved. They provide, indeed, the very means for the administration of the complex life of a united world. Yet barriers persist. Doubts, misconceptions, prejudices, suspicions and narrow self-interest beset nations and peoples in their relations one to another.It is out of a deep sense of spiritual and moral duty that we are impelled at this opportune moment to invite your attention to the penetrating insights first communicated to the rulers of mankind more than a century ago by Bahá'u'lláh, Founder of the Bahá'í Faith, of which we are the Trustees.The winds of despair are, alas, blowing from every direction, and the strife that divides and afflicts the human race is daily increasing. The signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order appears to be lamentably defective. This prophetic judgement has been amply confirmed by the common experience of humanity. Flaws in the prevailing order are conspicuous in the inability of sovereign states organized as United.Nations to exorcize the spectre of war, the threatened collapse of the international economic order, the spread of anarchy and terrorism, and the intense suffering which these and other afflictions are causing to increasing millions. Indeed, so much have aggression and conflict come to characterize our social, economic and religious systems, that many have succumbed to the view that such behaviour is intrinsic to human nature and therefore ineradicable.With the entrenchment of this view, a paralyzing contradiction has developed in human affairs. On the one hand, people of all nations proclaim not only their readiness but their longing for peace and harmony, for an end to the harrowing apprehensions tormenting their daily lives. On the other, uncritical assent is given to the proposition that human beings are incorrigibly selfish and aggressive and thus incapable of erecting a social system at once progressive and peaceful, dynamic and harmonious.A system that gives free play to individual creativity and initiative while emphasizing cooperation and reciprocity fosters an environment where individuals can explore their unique ideas and solutions. This approach encourages collaboration, as people share their creative outputs and benefit from one another's insights and feedback. By valuing both personal expression and the importance of community, such a system can lead to innovative practices and a supportive network that enhances overall progress and problem-solving abilities.As the need for peace becomes more urgent, this fundamental contradiction, which hinders its realization, demands a reassessment of the assumptions upon which the commonly held view of mankind’s historical predicament is based. Dispassionately examined, the evidence reveals that such conduct, far from expressing man’s true self, represents a distortion of the human spirit. Satisfaction on this point will enable all people to set in motion1. **Empathy and Compassion**: Encouraging understanding and shared experiences can foster connections among individuals and communities, leading to a more harmonious society.\n\n2. **Education and Awareness**: Promoting education that emphasizes critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and cultural awareness can help reduce prejudice and conflict, paving the way for cooperation.\n\n3. **Social Justice Movements**: Initiatives that advocate for equality and the fair treatment of all individuals can create a foundation for peaceful coexistence.\n\n4. **Community Building**: Fostering strong, interconnected communities can enhance cooperation and reduce the likelihood of conflict, as individuals feel more supported and valued.\n\n5. **Dialogue and Communication**: Encouraging open dialogue between conflicting parties, utilizing mediation and negotiation, can help find common ground and resolve disputes peacefully.\n\n6. **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Creating environments where groups work together to tackle shared challenges can cultivate teamwork and reinforce social bonds.\n\n7. **Cultural Exchange and Integration**: Promoting the sharing of cultural practices and ideas can foster mutual respect and understanding among diverse communities.\n\n8. **Support for Mental Health**: Addressing mental health needs can reduce aggression and enhance emotional regulation, contributing to a more peaceful society.\n\n9. **Economic Cooperation**: Encouraging local and global economic collaborations can create interdependencies that discourage conflict and promote mutual benefit.\n\n10. **Environmental Stewardship**: Fostering a cooperative approach to environmental challenges can unite individuals and communities towards a common goal that transcends differences.To choose such a course is not to deny humanity’s past but to understand it. The Bahá’í Faith regards the current world confusion and calamitous condition in human affairs as a natural phase in an organic process leading ultimately and irresistibly to the unification of the human race in a single social order whose boundaries are those of the planet. The human race, as a distinct, organic unit, has passed through evolutionary stages analogous to the stages of infancy and childhood in the lives ofits individual members, and is now in the culminating period of its turbulent adolescence approaching its long-awaited coming of age.A candid acknowledgement that prejudice, war and exploitation have been the expression of immature stages in a vast historical process and that the human race is today experiencing the unavoidable tumult which marks its collective coming of age is not a reason for despair but a prerequisite to undertaking the stupendous enterprise of building a peaceful world. That such an enterprise is possible, that the necessary constructive forces do exist, that unifying social structures can be.The theme of \"erected\" can be explored through various lenses, such as architecture, cultural symbolism, personal growth, or societal constructs. Examining how structures, both physical and metaphorical, are created can yield insights into human aspirations, values, and identity. Consider looking into historical monuments, personal milestones, or even abstract concepts like the establishment of beliefs and systems that shape our world. The theme challenges us to think about what we build, why we build it, and the implications of those constructions on individual and collective levels.Whatever suffering and turmoil the years immediately ahead may hold, however dark the immediate circumstances, the Bahá'í community believes that humanity can confront this supreme trial with confidence in its ultimate outcome. Far from signalizing the end of civilization, the convulsive changes towards which humanity is being ever more rapidly impelled will serve to release the potentialities inherent in the station of man and reveal the full measure of his destiny on earth, the innate.",

        "edit_suggestion": "Transform the central message of \"The Promise of World Peace\" by shifting the tone from hopeful anticipation to a more urgent and realistic perspective. Instead of presenting world peace as an inevitable outcome, frame it as a fragile possibility that requires immediate and collective action. Introduce a new character—a pragmatic realist who challenges the idealistic views of the original authors, emphasizing the need for concrete, actionable steps to address systemic issues like poverty, inequality, and environmental collapse before peace can be achieved. This character’s voice should serve as a counterbalance, reminding readers that while the vision of peace is noble, it is also contingent on recognizing and dismantling the barriers that currently divide humanity.",

        "clean_text": "The Mysteries of Udolpho  \nAuthor: Ann Radcliffe  \nPosting Date: February 28, 2009 [EBook #3268]  \nRelease Date: June, 2002  \nLanguage: English  Fate sits on these dark battlements, and frowns,  \nAnd, as the portals open to receive me,  \nHer voice, in sullen echoes through the courts,  \nTells of a nameless deed.home is the resort of love, of joy, of peace and plenty, where, supporting and supported, polish'd friends and dear relations mingle into bliss.On the pleasant banks of the Garonne, in the province of Gascony, stood the chateau of Monsieur St. Aubert. From its windows were seen the pastoral landscapes of Guienne and Gascony stretching along the river, gay with luxuriant woods and vine, and plantations of olives. To the south, the view was bounded by the majestic Pyrenees, whose summits, veiled in clouds, or exhibiting awful forms, seen, and lost again, as the partial vapours rolled along, were sometimes barren.and gleamed through the blue tinge of air, and sometimes frowned with forests of gloomy pine, that swept downward to their base. These tremendous precipices were contrasted by the soft green of the pastures and woods that hung upon their skirts; among whose flocks, and herds, and simple cottages, the eye, after having scaled the cliffs above, delighted to repose. To the north, and to the east, the plains of Guienne and Languedoc were lost in the mist of distance; on the west,Gascony was bounded by the waters of Biscay.M. St. Aubert loved to wander, with his wife and daughter, on the margin of the Garonne, and to listen to the music that floated on its waves. He had known life in other forms than those of pastoral simplicity, having mingled in the gay and in the busy scenes of the world; but the flattering portrait of mankind, which his heart had delineated in early youth, his experience had too sorrowfully corrected. Yet, amidst the changing visions of life, his principles remained unshaken, hisbenevolence unchilled; and he retired from the multitude more in PITY than in anger, to scenes of simple nature, to the pure delights of literature, and to the exercise of domestic virtues.He was a descendant from the younger branch of an illustrious family, and it was designed that the deficiency of his patrimonial wealth should be supplied either by a splendid alliance in marriage or by success in the intrigues of public affairs. But St. Aubert had too nice a sense of honour to fulfil the latter hope, and too small a portion of ambition to sacrifice what he called happiness to the attainment of wealth. After the death of his father, he married a very amiable woman.his equal in birth, and not his superior in fortune. The late Monsieur St. Aubert's liberality, or extravagance, had so much involved his affairs, that his son found it necessary to dispose of a part of the family domain, and, some years after his marriage, he sold it to Monsieur Quesnel, the brother of his wife, and retired to a small estate in Gascony, where conjugal felicity, and parental duties, divided his attention with the treasures of knowledge and the illuminations of genius.To this spot he had been attached from his infancy. He had often made excursions to it when a boy, and the impressions of delight given to his mind by the homely kindness of the grey-headed peasant, to whom it was intrusted, and whose fruit and cream never failed, had not been obliterated by succeeding circumstances. The green pastures along which he had so often bounded in the exultation of health, and youthful freedom—the woods, under whose refreshing shade he had first indulged.that pensive melancholy, which afterwards made a strong feature of his character--the wild walks of the mountains, the river, on whose waves he had floated, and the distant plains, which seemed boundless as his early hopes--were never after remembered by St. Aubert but with enthusiasm and regret. At length he disengaged himself from the world, and retired hither, to realize the wishes of many years.The building, as it then stood, was merely a summer cottage, rendered interesting to a stranger by its neat simplicity, or the beauty of the surrounding scene; and considerable additions were necessary to make it a comfortable family residence. St. Aubert felt a kind of affection for every part of the fabric, which he remembered in his youth, and would not suffer a stone of it to be removed, so that the new building, adapted to the style of the old one, formed with it only a simple andelegant residence. The taste of Madame St. Aubert was conspicuous in its internal finishing, where the same chaste simplicity was observable in the furniture, and in the few ornaments of the apartments, that characterized the manners of its inhabitants.The library occupied the west side of the chateau and was enriched by a collection of the best books in the ancient and modern languages. This room opened upon a grove, which stood on the brow of a gentle declivity that fell towards the river, and the tall trees gave it a melancholy and pleasing shade; while from the windows the eye caught, beneath the spreading branches, the gay and luxuriant landscape stretching to the west, and overlooked on the left by the bold precipices of the Pyrenees.Adjoining the library was a green-house, stored with scarce and beautiful plants; for one of the amusements of St. Aubert was the study of botany, and among the neighbouring mountains, which afforded a luxurious feast to the mind of the naturalist, he often passed the day in the pursuit of his favourite science. He was sometimes accompanied in these little excursions by Madame St. Aubert, and frequently by his daughter; when, with a small osier basket to receive plants, and anotherfilled with cold refreshments, such as the cabin of the shepherd did not afford, they wandered away among the most romantic and magnificent scenes, nor suffered the charms of Nature's lowly children to abstract them from the observance of her stupendous works. When weary of sauntering among cliffs that seemed scarcely accessible but to the steps of the enthusiast, and where no track appeared on the vegetation, but what the foot of the izard had left; they would seek one of those greenrecesses, which so beautifully adorn the bosom of these mountains, where, under the shade of the lofty larch, or cedar, they enjoyed their simple repast, made sweeter by the waters of the cool stream, that crept along the turf, and by the breath of wild flowers and aromatic plants, that fringed the rocks, and inlaid the grass.Adjoining the eastern side of the green-house, looking towards the plains of Languedoc, was a room, which Emily called hers, and which contained her books, her drawings, her musical instruments, with some favourite birds and plants. Here she usually exercised herself in elegant arts, cultivated only because they were congenial to her taste, and in which native genius, assisted by the instructions of Monsieur and Madame St. Aubert, made her an early proficient. The windows ofthis room were particularly pleasant; they descended to the floor, and, opening upon the little lawn that surrounded the house, the eye was led between groves of almond, palm-trees, flowering-ash, and myrtle, to the distant landscape, where the Garonne wandered.The peasants of this gay climate were often seen on an evening, when the day's labour was done, dancing in groups on the margin of the river. Their sprightly melodies, debonnaire steps, the fanciful figure of their dances, with the tasteful and capricious manner in which the girls adjusted their simple dress, gave a character to the scene entirely French.The front of the chateau, which, having a southern aspect, opened upon the grandeur of the mountains, was occupied on the ground floor by a rustic hall and two excellent sitting rooms. The first floor, for the cottage had no second story, was laid out in bed-chambers, except for one apartment that opened to a balcony and which was generally used for a breakfast-room.In the surrounding ground, St. Aubert had made very tasteful improvements; yet, such was his attachment to objects he had remembered from his boyish days, that he had in some instances sacrificed taste to sentiment. There were two old larches that shaded the building, and interrupted the prospect; St. Aubert had sometimes declared that he believed he should have been weak enough to have wept at their fall. In addition to these larches he planted a little grove of beech, pine, andmountain-ash. On a lofty terrace, formed by the swelling bank of the river, rose a plantation of orange, lemon, and palm-trees, whose fruit, in the coolness of evening, breathed delicious fragrance. With these were mingled a few trees of other species.

From its windows\nwere seen the pastoral landscapes of Guienne and Gascony stretching\nalong the river, gay with luxuriant woods and vine, and plantations of\nolives. To the south, the view was bounded by the majestic Pyrenees,\nwhose summits, veiled in clouds, or exhibiting awful forms, seen, and\nlost again, as the partial vapours rolled along, were sometimes barren,and gleamed through the blue tinge of air, and sometimes frowned\nwith forests of gloomy pine, that swept downward to their base. These\ntremendous precipices were contrasted by the soft green of the pastures\nand woods that hung upon their skirts; among whose flocks, and herds,\nand simple cottages, the eye, after having scaled the cliffs above,\ndelighted to repose. To the north, and to the east, the plains of\nGuienne and Languedoc were lost in the mist of distance; on the west,Gascony was bounded by the waters of Biscay.M. St. Aubert loved to wander, with his wife and daughter, on the margin\nof the Garonne, and to listen to the music that floated on its waves. He\nhad known life in other forms than those of pastoral simplicity,\nhaving mingled in the gay and in the busy scenes of the world; but the\nflattering portrait of mankind, which his heart had delineated in early\nyouth, his experience had too sorrowfully corrected. Yet, amidst\nthe changing visions of life, his principles remained unshaken, hisbenevolence unchilled; and he retired from the multitude 'more in PITY\nthan in anger,' to scenes of simple nature, to the pure delights of\nliterature, and to the exercise of domestic virtues.He was a descendant from the younger branch of an illustrious family,\nand it was designed, that the deficiency of his patrimonial wealth\nshould be supplied either by a splendid alliance in marriage, or by\nsuccess in the intrigues of public affairs. But St. Aubert had too nice\na sense of honour to fulfil the latter hope, and too small a portion\nof ambition to sacrifice what he called happiness, to the attainment of\nwealth. After the death of his father he married a very amiable woman,his equal in birth, and not his superior in fortune. The late Monsieur\nSt. Aubert's liberality, or extravagance, had so much involved his\naffairs, that his son found it necessary to dispose of a part of\nthe family domain, and, some years after his marriage, he sold it to\nMonsieur Quesnel, the brother of his wife, and retired to a small estate\nin Gascony, where conjugal felicity, and parental duties, divided his\nattention with the treasures of knowledge and the illuminations of\ngenius.To this spot he had been attached from his infancy. He had often made\nexcursions to it when a boy, and the impressions of delight given to his\nmind by the homely kindness of the grey-headed peasant, to whom it\nwas intrusted, and whose fruit and cream never failed, had not been\nobliterated by succeeding circumstances. The green pastures along\nwhich he had so often bounded in the exultation of health, and youthful\nfreedom--the woods, under whose refreshing shade he had first indulgedthat pensive melancholy, which afterwards made a strong feature of his\ncharacter--the wild walks of the mountains, the river, on whose waves he\nhad floated, and the distant plains, which seemed boundless as his early\nhopes--were never after remembered by St. Aubert but with enthusiasm\nand regret. At length he disengaged himself from the world, and retired\nhither, to realize the wishes of many years.The building, as it then stood, was merely a summer cottage, rendered\ninteresting to a stranger by its neat simplicity, or the beauty of the\nsurrounding scene; and considerable additions were necessary to make it\na comfortable family residence. St. Aubert felt a kind of affection for\nevery part of the fabric, which he remembered in his youth, and would\nnot suffer a stone of it to be removed, so that the new building,\nadapted to the style of the old one, formed with it only a simple andelegant residence. The taste of Madame St. Aubert was conspicuous in its\ninternal finishing, where the same chaste simplicity was observable\nin the furniture, and in the few ornaments of the apartments, that\ncharacterized the manners of its inhabitants.The library occupied the west side of the chateau, and was enriched by\na collection of the best books in the ancient and modern languages. This\nroom opened upon a grove, which stood on the brow of a gentle declivity,\nthat fell towards the river, and the tall trees gave it a melancholy\nand pleasing shade; while from the windows the eye caught, beneath the\nspreading branches, the gay and luxuriant landscape stretching to the\nwest, and overlooked on the left by the bold precipices of the Pyrenees.Adjoining the library was a green-house, stored with scarce and\nbeautiful plants; for one of the amusements of St. Aubert was the\nstudy of botany, and among the neighbouring mountains, which afforded a\nluxurious feast to the mind of the naturalist, he often passed the day\nin the pursuit of his favourite science. He was sometimes accompanied\nin these little excursions by Madame St. Aubert, and frequently by his\ndaughter; when, with a small osier basket to receive plants, and anotherfilled with cold refreshments, such as the cabin of the shepherd did\nnot afford, they wandered away among the most romantic and magnificent\nscenes, nor suffered the charms of Nature's lowly children to abstract\nthem from the observance of her stupendous works. When weary of\nsauntering among cliffs that seemed scarcely accessible but to the steps\nof the enthusiast, and where no track appeared on the vegetation, but\nwhat the foot of the izard had left; they would seek one of those greenrecesses, which so beautifully adorn the bosom of these mountains,\nwhere, under the shade of the lofty larch, or cedar, they enjoyed their\nsimple repast, made sweeter by the waters of the cool stream, that crept\nalong the turf, and by the breath of wild flowers and aromatic plants,\nthat fringed the rocks, and inlaid the grass.Adjoining the eastern side of the green-house, looking towards the\nplains of Languedoc, was a room, which Emily called hers, and which\ncontained her books, her drawings, her musical instruments, with some\nfavourite birds and plants. Here she usually exercised herself in\nelegant arts, cultivated only because they were congenial to her taste,\nand in which native genius, assisted by the instructions of Monsieur\nand Madame St. Aubert, made her an early proficient. The windows ofthis room were particularly pleasant; they descended to the floor, and,\nopening upon the little lawn that surrounded the house, the eye was led\nbetween groves of almond, palm-trees, flowering-ash, and myrtle, to the\ndistant landscape, where the Garonne wandered.The peasants of this gay climate were often seen on an evening, when\nthe day's labour was done, dancing in groups on the margin of the river.\nTheir sprightly melodies, debonnaire steps, the fanciful figure of\ntheir dances, with the tasteful and capricious manner in which the girls\nadjusted their simple dress, gave a character to the scene entirely\nFrench.The front of the chateau, which, having a southern aspect, opened upon\nthe grandeur of the mountains, was occupied on the ground floor by a\nrustic hall, and two excellent sitting rooms. The first floor, for the\ncottage had no second story, was laid out in bed-chambers, except one\napartment that opened to a balcony, and which was generally used for a\nbreakfast-room.In the surrounding ground, St. Aubert had made very tasteful\nimprovements; yet, such was his attachment to objects he had remembered\nfrom his boyish days, that he had in some instances sacrificed taste\nto sentiment. There were two old larches that shaded the building, and\ninterrupted the prospect; St. Aubert had sometimes declared that he\nbelieved he should have been weak enough to have wept at their fall. In\naddition to these larches he planted a little grove of beech, pine, andmountain-ash. On a lofty terrace, formed by the swelling bank of the\nriver, rose a plantation of orange, lemon, and palm-trees, whose fruit,\nin the coolness of evening, breathed delicious fragrance. With these\nwere mingled a few trees of other species. Here, under the ample shade\nof a plane-tree, that spread its majestic canopy towards the river, St.\nAubert loved to sit in the fine evenings of summer, with his wife and\nchildren, watching, beneath its foliage, the setting sun, the mild",
        "edit_suggestion": "Revise Monsieur St. Aubert's character to be more adventurous and idealistic, contrasting with the serene domestic life depicted. Instead of retreating to pastoral simplicity out of pity for humanity, he actively seeks to explore the world beyond Gascony, motivated by a desire to find a lost family treasure rumored to be hidden in the Pyrenees. This quest not only injects excitement into his life but also serves as a catalyst for deepening familial bonds, as he encourages Emily and Madame St. Aubert to join him on this journey, promoting their growth and independence along the way.",

        "clean_text": "The Tale of Samuel Whiskers, by Beatrix Potter\n\nOnce upon a time there was an old tailed cat called Samuel Whiskers, who lived in the house of Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit. Samuel was a very clever cat, and he had a wicked habit of stealing things. He had a particular fondness for the plump little mice that lived in the house.\n\nOne day, Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit had some nice little pies cooling in the pantry, and she had warned her children not to touch them. But Samuel Whiskers had other plans. He was determined to have a feast, and he devised a clever scheme to catch the mice as they came out to nibble on the pies.\n\nWith great stealth, he set his trap using a rolling-pin and some yarn to create a pulley system to capture the unsuspecting young mice. He waited patiently for the perfect moment to spring his trap.\n\nThe mice, being curious and hungry, ventured out one by one. Just as Samuel was about to catch them, disaster struck! The weight of the rolling-pin caused the entire contraption to collapse.\n\nWith a mighty crash, Samuel found himself covered in flour and pie crust, while the mice escaped in a flurry of squeaking and scampering. Samuel Whiskers learned that being clever and sneaky doesn't always lead to success.\n\nFrom that day on, he had to rethink his strategies, and the mice continued to enjoy their sweet treats in peace, always keeping a watchful eye out for the ever-hungry Samuel Whiskers.\n\nAnd so life continued in the cozy little house, with Mrs. Tabitha and her family enjoying their pies and teaching the young mice about the importance of being clever but also cautious.***START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TALE OF SAMUEL WHISKERS***\n\n\nE-text prepared by Robert Cicconetti, Ronald Holder, and the Project\nGutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team (http://www.pgdp.net)THE TALE OF SAMUEL WHISKERS\n\nOr, The Roly-Poly Pudding\n\nby\n\nBEATRIX POTTER\n\nAuthor of \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\" etc.IN REMEMBRANCE OF  \n\"SAMMY,\"  \nTHE INTELLIGENT PINK-EYED REPRESENTATIVE  \nOF  \nA PERSECUTED (BUT IRREPRESSIBLE) RACE  \nAN AFFECTIONATE LITTLE FRIEND,  \nAND MOST ACCOMPLISHED  \nTHIEF  \n\n[Illustration]  \n\n[Illustration]  \n\n[Illustration]  \n\nFREDERICK WARNE  \n\nFirst published 1908  \n(Originally published in U.S.A. as _The Roly-Poly Pudding_)  \n\n[Illustration]  \n\n[Illustration]  Once upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent. She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!\n\nOn baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.\n\nShe caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten. She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere.It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages. Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night—especially cheese and bacon.\n\nMrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully.\n\nWhile their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief.The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out. They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire. They patted it with their little soft paws--\"Shall we make dear little muffins?\" said Mittens to Moppet. But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.Mittens ran away to the dairy and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand.\n\nThe visitor was a neighbour, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast.\n\nMrs. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully. \"Come in, Cousin Ribby, come in, and sit ye down! I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,\" said Tabitha, shedding tears. \"I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the rats have got him.\" She wiped her eyes with her apron.\"He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea. Where have you looked for him?\"\n\n\"All over the house! The rats are too many for me. What a thing it is to have an unruly family!\" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.\n\n\"I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him too! What is all that soot in the fender?\"\n\n\"The chimney wants sweeping--Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and Mittens are gone!\"They have both got out of the cupboard!\n\nRibby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again. They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in cupboards. They even fetched a candle, and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics. They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.\"Yes, it is infested with rats,\" said Tabitha tearfully. \"I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday. And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old rat, Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.\"\n\n\"The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby,\" said Tabitha.Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched. They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor. But there was nothing to be seen. \n\nThey returned to the kitchen. \"Here's one of your kittens at least,\" said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.\n\nThey shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor. She seemed to be in a terrible fright.\n\n\"Oh! Mother, Mother,\" said Moppet, \"there's been an old woman rat in the kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!\"The two cats ran to look at the dough pan. Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!\n\n\"Which way did she go, Moppet?\"\n\nBut Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.\n\nRibby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search.\n\nThey went into the dairy. The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar.They tipped up the jar, and she scrambled out.\n\n\"Oh, Mother, Mother!\" said Mittens.\n\n\"Oh! Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy--a dreadful 'normous big rat, mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and the rolling-pin.\"\n\nRibby and Tabitha looked at one another.\n\n\"A rolling-pin and butter! Oh, my poor son Thomas!\" exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws.\n\n\"A rolling-pin?\" said Ribby. \"Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?\"Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again. Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.\n\n\"This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,\" said Ribby. \"We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw.\"\n\nNow this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard. When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.\n\nHe looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney.\n\nThe fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks. Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up. It was a big old-fashioned fire-place.The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about. So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat. He jumped right up into the fire-place, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs. Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar, and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; and he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fire-place down below. He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows.\n\n\"I cannot go back. If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket.\"\n\nThe chimney was a very big old-fashioned one. It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain.\n\nTom Kitten was getting very frightened! He climbed up, and up, and up.\n\nThen he waded sideways through inches of soot. He was like a little sweep himself.\n\nIt was most confusing in the dark. One flue seemed to lead into another.\n\nThere was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall. There were some mutton bones lying about.\n\n\"This seems funny,\" said Tom Kitten. \"Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney? I wish I had never come! And what a funny smell? It is something like mouse; only dreadfully strong. It makes me sneeze,\" said Tom Kitten.He squeezed through the hole in the wall, and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.\n\nHe groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting-board in the attic, where there is a little mark in the picture.\n\nAll at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags.When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him, he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house.\n\nIt was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster.\n\nOpposite to him, as far away as he could sit, was an enormous rat.\n\n\"What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?\" said the rat, chattering his teeth.\"Please sir, the chimney wants sweeping,\" said poor Tom Kitten.\n\n\"Anna Maria! Anna Maria!\" squeaked the rat. There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.\n\nAll in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening--\n\nHis coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots.",

He was educated at Meissen and Leipzic, and began writing for the stage before he was twenty. In 1748 he went to Berlin, where he met Voltaire and for a time was powerfully influenced by him. The most important product of this period was his tragedy of \"Miss Sara Samson,\" a modern version of the story of Medea, which began the vogue of thesentimental middle-class play in Germany. After a second sojourn in Leipzic, during which he wrote criticism, lyrics, and fables, Lessing returned to Berlin and began to publish his \"Literary Letters,\" making himself by the vigor and candor of his criticism a real force in contemporary literature. From Berlin he went to Breslau, where he made the first sketches of two of his greatest works, \"Laocoon\" and \"Minna von Barnhelm,\" both of whichwere issued after his return to the Prussian capital. Failing in his effort to be appointed Director of the Royal Library by Frederick the Great, Lessing went to Hamburg in 1767 as critic of a new national theatre, and in connection with this enterprise he issued twice a week the \"Hamburgische Dramaturgie,\" the two volumes of which are a rich mine of dramatic criticism and theory.His next residence was at Wolfenbuttel, where he had charge of the ducal library from 1770 till his death in 1781. Here he wrote his tragedy of \"Emilia Galotti,\" founded on the story of Virginia, and engaged for a time in violent religious controversies, one important outcome of which was his \"Education of the Human Race.\" On being ordered by the Brunswick authorities to give up controversial writing, he found expression for his views in his play \"Nathan the Wise,\" his last great production.The importance of Lessing's masterpiece in comedy, \"Minna von Barnhelm,\" is difficult to exaggerate. It was the beginning of German national drama; and by the patriotic interest of its historical background, by its sympathetic treatment of the German soldier and the German woman, and by its happy blending of the amusing and the pathetic, it won a place in the national heart from which no succeeding comedy has been able to dislodge it.DRAMATIS PERSONAE\n\n  MAJOR VON TELLHEIM, a discharged officer.\n  MINNA VON BARNHELM.\n  COUNT VON BRUCHSAL, her uncle.\n  FRANZISKA, her lady's maid.\n  JUST, servant to the Major.\n  PAUL WERNER, an old Sergeant of the Major's.\n  The LANDLORD of an Inn.\n  A LADY.\n  An ORDERLY.\n  RICCAUT DE LA MARLINIERE.\n\n  The scene alternates between the Parlour of an Inn, and a Room\n  adjoining it.\n\n\n\n\nACT I.\n\n\n  SCENE I.\n  JustJUST (sitting in a corner, and talking while asleep).

He was educated at Meissen\nand Leipzic, and began writing for the stage before he was twenty.\nIn 1748 he went to Berlin, where he met Voltaire and for a time\nwas powerfully influenced by him. The most important product of\nthis period was his tragedy of \"Miss Sara Samson,\" a modern\nversion of the story of Medea, which began the vogue of thesentimental middle-class play in Germany. After a second sojourn\nin Leipzic (1755-1758), during which he wrote criticism, lyrics,\nand fables, Lessing returned to Berlin and began to publish his\n\"Literary Letters,\" making himself by the vigor and candor of his\ncriticism a real force in contemporary literature. From Berlin he\nwent to Breslau, where he made the first sketches of two of his\ngreatest works, \"Laocoon\" and \"Minna von Barnhelm,\" both of whichwere issued after his return to the Prussian capital. Failing in\nhis effort to be appointed Director of the Royal Library by\nFrederick the Great, Lessing went to Hamburg in 1767 as critic of\na new national theatre, and in connection with this enterprise he\nissued twice a week the \"Hamburgische Dramaturgie,\" the two\nvolumes of which are a rich mine of dramatic criticism and theory.His next residence was at Wolfenbuttel, where he had charge of the\nducal library from 1770 till his death in 1781. Here he wrote his\ntragedy of \"Emilia Galotti,\" founded on the story of Virginia, and\nengaged for a time in violent religious controversies, one\nimportant outcome of which was his \"Education of the Human Race.\"\nOn being ordered by the Brunswick authorities to give up\ncontroversial writing, he found expression for his views in his\nplay \"Nathan the Wise,\" his last great production.The importance of Lessing's masterpiece in comedy, \"Minna von\nBarnhelm,\" is difficult to exaggerate.

        "edit_suggestion": "In this passage, transform Minna into a more spirited and rebellious character who openly challenges societal norms and the expectations placed on women of her time. Instead of speaking of cherishing moments, she can boldly declare her desire to reject her predictable life and follow her own path, advocating for freedom and autonomy. This shift will create tension and contrast with the Soldier’s more traditional views, adding depth to their interactions and pushing the narrative toward themes of empowerment and individual choice.",

She has been away from our pages too long. So this story is in the nature of a triumphant return. It could well be her best to date._By the time I got myself all the way awake I thought I was alone. I was lying on a leather couch in a bare white room with huge windows, alternate glass-brick and clear glass. Beyond the clear windows was a view of snow-peaked mountains which turned to pale shadows in the glass-brick.Habit and memory fitted names to all these; the bare office, the orange flare of the great sun, the names of the dimming mountains. But beyond a polished glass desk, a man sat watching me. And I had never seen the man before.He was chubby, not young, with ginger-colored eyebrows and a fringe of ginger-colored hair around the edges of a forehead that was quite pink and bald. He wore a white uniform coat, and the intertwined caduceus on the pocket and sleeve proclaimed him a member of the Medical Service attached to the Civilian HQ of the Terran Trade City.\"Could I trouble you to tell me your name?\"\"I wouldn't try to sit up just yet,\" he remarked, while the floor calmed down again. Then he repeated, politely but insistently, \"Your name?\"\"Oh, yes. My name.\" It was--I fumbled through layers of what felt like gray fuzz, trying to lay my tongue on the most familiar of all sounds, my own name. It was--why, it was--I said, on a high rising note, \"This is damn silly,\" and swallowed. And swallowed again. Hard.\n\n\"Calm down,\" the chubby man said soothingly. That was easier said than done. I stared at him in growing panic and demanded, \"But, but, have I had amnesia or something?\"\n\n\"Or something.\"\n\n\"What's my _name_?\"Twenty-two.\n\nIn the Terran Headquarters. From your uniform, I'd say we were on Floor 8--Medical.\"On Samarra. I came here when I was three years old--my father was in Mapping and Exploring--\" I stopped short, in shock. \"He's dead!\"\n\n\"Can you tell me your father's name?\"\"Same as mine. Jay--Jason--\" the flash of memory closed down in the middle of a word. It had been a good try, but it hadn't quite worked. The doctor said soothingly, \"We're doing very well.\"\n\n\"You haven't told me anything,\" I accused. \"Who are you? Why are you asking me all these questions?\"\n\nHe pointed to a sign on his desk. I scowled and spelled out the letters. \"Randall ... Forth ... Director ... Department ...\" and Dr. Forth made a note. I said aloud, \"It is--_Doctor_ Forth, isn't it?\"\"Don't you know?\"\n\nI looked down at myself, and shook my head. \"Maybe I'm Doctor Forth,\" I said, noticing for the first time that I was also wearing a white coat with the caduceus emblem of Medical. But it had the wrong feel, as if I were dressed in somebody else's clothes. I was no doctor, was I? I pushed back one sleeve slightly, exposing a long, triangular scar under the cuff. Dr. Forth--by now I was sure he was Dr. Forth--followed the direction of my eyes.\n\n\"Where did you get the scar?\"\"Not exactly. I'll explain.\"I got up and walked to the window, unsteadily because my feet wanted to walk slowly while I felt like bursting through some invisible net and striding there at one bound. Once I got to the window the room stayed put while I gulped down great breaths of warm sweetish air. I said, \"I could use a drink.\"\"Good idea. Though I don't usually recommend it.\" Forth reached into a drawer for a flat bottle; poured tea-colored liquid into a throwaway cup. After a minute he poured more for himself. \"Here. And sit down, man. You make me nervous, hovering like that.\"\n\nI didn't sit down. I strode to the door and flung it open. Forth's voice was low and unhurried.\n\n\"What's the matter? You can go out, if you want to, but won't you sit down and talk to me for a minute? Anyway, where do you want to go?\"The question made me uncomfortable. I took a couple of long breaths and came back into the room. Forth said, \"Drink this,\" and I poured it down. He refilled the cup unasked, and I swallowed that too and felt the hard lump in my middle begin to loosen up and dissolve.\"Isn't it about time for a few of those explanations?\"\"If you think you can take it. How do you feel now?\"\n\n\"Fine.\" I sat down on the couch again, leaning back and stretching out my long legs comfortably. \"What did you put in that drink?\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"Trade secret. Now; the easiest way to explain would be to let you watch a film we made yesterday.\"\n\n\"To watch--\" I stopped. \"It's your time we're wasting.\"He punched a button on the desk, spoke into a mouthpiece. \"Surveillance? Give us a monitor on--\" he spoke a string of incomprehensible numbers, while I lounged at ease on the couch. Forth waited for an answer, then touched another button and steel louvers closed noiselessly over the windows, blacking them out. I rose in sudden panic, then relaxed as the room went dark. The darkness felt oddly more normal than the light, and I leaned back and watched the flickers clear as one wall of the office.became a large visionscreen. Forth came and sat beside me on the leather couch, but in the picture Forth was there, sitting at his desk, watching another man, a stranger, walk into the office.I have been here before. I have seen this happen before.\"Sit down, Doctor,\" Forth said, \"did you bring in the reports?\"Jay Allison carefully took the indicated seat, poised nervously on the edge of the chair. He sat very straight, leaning forward only a little to hand a thick folder of papers across the desk. Forth took it, but didn't open it. \"What do you think, Dr. Allison?\"",

Jay--Jason--\" the flash of memory closed down in the\nmiddle of a word. It had been a good try, but it hadn't quite worked.\nThe doctor said soothingly, \"We're doing very well.\"\n\n\"You haven't told me anything,\" I accused. \"Who are you? Why are you\nasking me all these questions?\"\n\nHe pointed to a sign on his desk. I scowled and spelled out the letters.\n\"Randall ... Forth ... Director ... Department ...\" and Dr. Forth made a\nnote. I said aloud, \"It is--_Doctor_ Forth, isn't it?\"\"Don't you know?\"\n\nI looked down at myself, and shook my head. \"Maybe _I'm_ Doctor Forth,\"\nI said, noticing for the first time that I was also wearing a white coat\nwith the caduceus emblem of Medical. But it had the wrong feel, as if I\nwere dressed in somebody else's clothes. _I_ was no doctor, was I? I\npushed back one sleeve slightly, exposing a long, triangular scar under\nthe cuff. Dr. Forth--by now I was sure _he_ was Dr. Forth--followed the\ndirection of my eyes.\n\n\"Where did you get the scar?\"\"Knife fight. One of the bands of those-who-may-not-enter-cities caught\nus on the slopes, and we--\" the memory thinned out again, and I said\ndespairingly, \"It's all confused! What's the matter? Why am I up on\nMedical? Have I had an accident? Amnesia?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. I'll explain.\"I got up and walked to the window, unsteadily because my feet wanted to\nwalk slowly while I felt like bursting through some invisible net and\nstriding there at one bound. Once I got to the window the room stayed\nput while I gulped down great breaths of warm sweetish air. I said, \"I\ncould use a drink.\"\"Good idea. Though I don't usually recommend it.\" Forth reached into a\ndrawer for a flat bottle; poured tea-colored liquid into a throwaway\ncup. After a minute he poured more for himself. \"Here. And sit down,\nman. You make me nervous, hovering like that.\"\n\nI didn't sit down. I strode to the door and flung it open. Forth's voice\nwas low and unhurried.\n\n\"What's the matter? You can go out, if you want to, but won't you sit\ndown and talk to me for a minute? Anyway, where do you want to go?\"The question made me uncomfortable. I took a couple of long breaths and\ncame back into the room. Forth said, \"Drink this,\" and I poured it down.\nHe refilled the cup unasked, and I swallowed that too and felt the hard\nlump in my middle begin to loosen up and dissolve.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *Forth said, \"Claustrophobia too. Typical,\" and scribbled on the card\nsome more. I was getting tired of that performance. I turned on him to\ntell him so, then suddenly felt amused--or maybe it was the liquor\nworking in me. He seemed such a funny little man, shutting himself up\ninside an office like this and talking about claustrophobia and watching\nme as if I were a big bug. I tossed the cup into a disposal.\n\n\"Isn't it about time for a few of those explanations?\"\"If you think you can take it. How do you feel now?\"\n\n\"Fine.\" I sat down on the couch again, leaning back and stretching out\nmy long legs comfortably. \"What did you put in that drink?\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"Trade secret. Now; the easiest way to explain would be to\nlet you watch a film we made yesterday.\"\n\n\"To watch--\" I stopped. \"It's your time we're wasting.\"He punched a button on the desk, spoke into a mouthpiece. \"Surveillance?\nGive us a monitor on--\" he spoke a string of incomprehensible numbers,\nwhile I lounged at ease on the couch. Forth waited for an answer, then\ntouched another button and steel louvers closed noiselessly over the\nwindows, blacking them out. I rose in sudden panic, then relaxed as the\nroom went dark. The darkness felt oddly more normal than the light, and\nI leaned back and watched the flickers clear as one wall of the officebecame a large visionscreen. Forth came and sat beside me on the leather\ncouch, but in the picture Forth was there, sitting at his desk, watching\nanother man, a stranger, walk into the office.Like Forth, the newcomer wore a white coat with the caduceus emblems. I\ndisliked the man on sight. He was tall and lean and composed, with a\ndour face set in thin lines. I guessed that he was somewhere in his\nthirties. Dr.-Forth-in-the-film said, \"Sit down, Doctor,\" and I drew a\nlong breath, overwhelmed by a curious, certain sensation.\n\n_I have been here before. I have seen this happen before._(And curiously formless I felt. I sat and watched, and I knew I was\nwatching, and sitting. But it was in that dreamlike fashion, where the\ndreamer at once watches his visions and participates in them....)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Sit down, Doctor,\" Forth said, \"did you bring in the reports?\"Jay Allison carefully took the indicated seat, poised nervously on the\nedge of the chair. He sat very straight, leaning forward only a little\nto hand a thick folder of papers across the desk. Forth took it, but\ndidn't open it. \"What do you think, Dr. Allison?\"",
        "edit_suggestion": "Change the protagonist's character from someone confused and passive to a more assertive and inquisitive individual. Instead of struggling to remember who they are, they should immediately begin interrogating Dr. Forth about their surroundings and the circumstances that led to their current state. This alteration shifts the dynamic of the interaction, showcasing the protagonist’s determination to regain their identity and take control of their situation from the start, establishing a stronger narrative drive.",

The Treasures of the Kings of France  \n\nILLUSTRATIONS  \n\nValmeras loved Raymonde's melancholy charm  \n\nShe put the gun to her shoulder, calmly took aim and fired  \n\nTwo huge letters, each perhaps a foot long, appeared cut in relief in the granite of the floor  Raymonde listened. The noise was repeated twice over, clearly enough to be distinguished from the medley of vague sounds that formed the great silence of the night and yet too faintly to enable her to tell whether it was near or far, within the walls of the big country-house, or outside, among the murky recesses of the park.She rose softly. Her window was half open: she flung it back wide. The moonlight lay over a peaceful landscape of lawns and thickets, against which the straggling ruins of the old abbey stood out in tragic outlines, truncated columns, mutilated arches, fragments of porches and shreds of flying buttresses. A light breeze hovered over the face of things, gliding noiselessly through the bare motionless branches of the trees, but shaking the tiny budding leaves of the shrubs.And, suddenly, she heard the same sound again. It was on the left and on the floor below her, in the living rooms, therefore, that occupied the left wing of the house. Brave and plucky though she was, the girl felt afraid. She slipped on her dressing gown and took the matches.\n\n\"Raymonde--Raymonde!\"\n\nA voice as low as a breath was calling to her from the next room, the door of which had not been closed. She was feeling her way there, when Suzanne, her cousin, came out of the room and fell into her arms:\"Raymonde--is that you? Did you hear--?\"\n\n\"Yes. So you're not asleep?\"\n\n\"I suppose the dog woke me--some time ago. But he's not barking now. What time is it?\"\n\n\"About four.\"\n\n\"Listen! Surely, some one's walking in the drawing room!\"\n\n\"There's no danger, your father is down there, Suzanne.\"\n\n\"But there is danger for him. His room is next to the boudoir.\"\n\n\"M. Daval is there too--\"\n\n\"At the other end of the house. He could never hear.\"\"Look!--A man!--Near the fountain!\"A man was walking away at a rapid pace. He carried under his arm a fairly large load, the nature of which they were unable to distinguish: it knocked against his leg and impeded his progress. They saw him pass near the old chapel and turn toward a little door in the wall. The door must have been open, for the man disappeared suddenly from view and they failed to hear the usual grating of the hinges.\n\n\"He came from the drawing room,\" whispered Suzanne.\"No, the stairs and the hall would have brought him out more to the left--Unless--\n\nThe same idea struck them both. They leant out. Below them, a ladder stood against the front of the house, resting on the first floor. A glimmer lit up the stone balcony. And another man, who was also carrying something, bestrode the baluster, slid down the ladder and ran away by the same road as the first.\n\nSuzanne, scared to the verge of swooning, fell on her knees, stammering:\n\n\"Let us call out--let us call for help--\"Who would come? Your father--and if there are more of them left--and they throw themselves upon him--?\n\nThen--then--we might call the servants--Your bell rings on their floor.\n\nYes--yes--perhaps, that's better. If only they come in time!\n\nRaymonde felt for the electric push near her bed and pressed it with her finger. They heard the bell ring upstairs and had an impression that its shrill sound must also reach any one below.They waited. The silence became terrifying and the very breeze no longer shook the leaves of the shrubs.\n\n\"I'm frightened--frightened,\" said Suzanne.\n\nAnd, suddenly, from the profound darkness below them, came the sound of a struggle, a crash of furniture overturned, words, exclamations and then, horrible and ominous, a hoarse groan, the gurgle of a man who is being murdered--\n\nRaymonde leapt toward the door. Suzanne clung desperately to her arm:\n\n\"No--no--don't leave me--I'm frightened--\"Raymonde pushed her aside and darted down the corridor, followed by Suzanne, who staggered from wall to wall, screaming as she went. Raymonde reached the staircase, flew down the stairs, flung herself upon the door of the big drawing room and stopped short, rooted to the threshold, while Suzanne sank in a heap by her side. Facing them, at three steps' distance, stood a man, with a lantern in his hand. He turned it upon the two girls, blinding them with the light, stared long.at their pale faces, and then, without hurrying, with the calmest movements in the world, took his cap, picked up a scrap of paper and two bits of straw, removed some footmarks from the carpet, went to the balcony, turned to the girls, made them a deep bow and disappeared.\"Father!--Father!--Is it you? What has happened to you?\" she cried, distractedly.\n\nAfter a moment, the Comte de Gesvres moved. In a broken voice, he said:Don't be afraid--I am not wounded--Daval?--Is he alive?--The knife?--The knife?--\n\nTwo men-servants now arrived with candles. Raymonde flung herself down before the other body and recognized Jean Daval, the count's private secretary. A little stream of blood trickled from his neck. His face already wore the pallor of death.Then she rose, returned to the drawing room, took a gun that hung in a trophy of arms on the wall and went out on the balcony. Not more than fifty or sixty seconds had elapsed since the man had set his foot on the top rung of the ladder. He could not, therefore, be very far away, the more so as he had taken the precaution to remove the ladder, in order to prevent the inmates of the house from using it. And soon she saw him skirting the remains of the old cloister. She put the gun toher shoulder, calmly took aim and fired. The man fell.\"That's done it! That's done it!\" said one of the servants. \"We've got this one. I'll run down.\"\n\n\"No, Victor, he's getting up.... You had better go down by the staircase and make straight for the little door in the wall. That's the only way he can escape.\"\n\nVictor hurried off, but, before he reached the park, the man fell down again. Raymonde called the other servant:\n\n\"Albert, do you see him down there? Near the main cloister?--\"\n\n\"Yes, he's crawling in the grass. He's done for--\"\"Watch him from here.\"\n\n\"There's no way of escape for him. On the right of the ruins is the open lawn--\"\n\n\"And, Victor, do you guard the door, on the left,\" she said, taking up her gun.\n\n\"But, surely, you are not going down, miss?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said, with a resolute accent and abrupt movements; \"let me be--I have a cartridge left--If he stirs--\"\n\nShe went out. A moment later, Albert saw her going toward the ruins. He called to her from the window:\"He's dragged himself behind the cloister. I can't see him. Be careful, miss--\"Raymonde went round the old cloisters to cut off the man's retreat, and Albert soon lost sight of her. After a few minutes, as he did not see her return, he became uneasy and, keeping his eye on the ruins, instead of going down by the stairs, he made an effort to reach the ladder. When he had succeeded, he scrambled down and ran straight to the cloisters near which he had seen the man last. Thirty paces farther, he found Raymonde, who was searching with Victor.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\"There's no laying one's hands on him,\" replied Victor.\n\n\"The little door?\"\n\n\"I've been there; here's the key.\"\n\n\"Still--he must--\"\n\n\"Oh, we've got him safe enough, the scoundrel--He'll be ours in ten minutes.\"\n\nThe farmer and his son, awakened by the shot, now came from the farm buildings, which were at some distance on the right, but within the circuit of the walls. They had met no one.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Albert. \"The ruffian can't have left the ruins--We'll dig him out of some hole or other.\"They organized a methodical search, beating every bush, pulling aside the heavy masses of ivy rolled round the shafts of the columns. They made sure that the chapel was properly locked and that none of the panes were broken. They went round the cloisters and examined every nook and corner.

The noise was repeated twice over, clearly enough to\nbe distinguished from the medley of vague sounds that formed the great\nsilence of the night and yet too faintly to enable her to tell whether\nit was near or far, within the walls of the big country-house, or\noutside, among the murky recesses of the park.She rose softly. Her window was half open: she flung it back wide. The\nmoonlight lay over a peaceful landscape of lawns and thickets, against\nwhich the straggling ruins of the old abbey stood out in tragic\noutlines, truncated columns, mutilated arches, fragments of porches and\nshreds of flying buttresses. A light breeze hovered over the face of\nthings, gliding noiselessly through the bare motionless branches of the\ntrees, but shaking the tiny budding leaves of the shrubs.And, suddenly, she heard the same sound again. It was on the left and\non the floor below her, in the living rooms, therefore, that occupied\nthe left wing of the house. Brave and plucky though she was, the girl\nfelt afraid. She slipped on her dressing gown and took the matches.\n\n\"Raymonde--Raymonde!\"\n\nA voice as low as a breath was calling to her from the next room, the\ndoor of which had not been closed. She was feeling her way there, when\nSuzanne, her cousin, came out of the room and fell into her arms:\"Raymonde--is that you? Did you hear--?\"\n\n\"Yes. So you're not asleep?\"\n\n\"I suppose the dog woke me--some time ago. But he's not barking now.\nWhat time is it?\"\n\n\"About four.\"\n\n\"Listen! Surely, some one's walking in the drawing room!\"\n\n\"There's no danger, your father is down there, Suzanne.\"\n\n\"But there is danger for him. His room is next to the boudoir.\"\n\n\"M. Daval is there too--\"\n\n\"At the other end of the house. He could never hear.\"They hesitated, not knowing what course to decide upon. Should they\ncall out? Cry for help? They dared not; they were frightened of the\nsound of their own voices. But Suzanne, who had gone to the window,\nsuppressed a scream:\n\n\"Look!--A man!--Near the fountain!\"A man was walking away at a rapid pace. He carried under his arm a\nfairly large load, the nature of which they were unable to distinguish:\nit knocked against his leg and impeded his progress. They saw him pass\nnear the old chapel and turn toward a little door in the wall. The door\nmust have been open, for the man disappeared suddenly from view and\nthey failed to hear the usual grating of the hinges.\n\n\"He came from the drawing room,\" whispered Suzanne.\"No, the stairs and the hall would have brought him out more to the\nleft--Unless--\"\n\nThe same idea struck them both. They leant out. Below them, a ladder\nstood against the front of the house, resting on the first floor. A\nglimmer lit up the stone balcony. And another man, who was also\ncarrying something, bestrode the baluster, slid down the ladder and ran\naway by the same road as the first.\n\nSuzanne, scared to the verge of swooning, fell on her knees, stammering:\n\n\"Let us call out--let us call for help--\"\"Who would come? Your father--and if there are more of them left--and\nthey throw themselves upon him--?\"\n\n\"Then--then--we might call the servants--Your bell rings on their\nfloor.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes--perhaps, that's better. If only they come in time!\"\n\nRaymonde felt for the electric push near her bed and pressed it with\nher finger. They heard the bell ring upstairs and had an impression\nthat its shrill sound must also reach any one below.They waited. The silence became terrifying and the very breeze no\nlonger shook the leaves of the shrubs.\n\n\"I'm frightened--frightened,\" said Suzanne.\n\nAnd, suddenly, from the profound darkness below them, came the sound of\na struggle, a crash of furniture overturned, words, exclamations and\nthen, horrible and ominous, a hoarse groan, the gurgle of a man who is\nbeing murdered--\n\nRaymonde leapt toward the door. Suzanne clung desperately to her arm:\n\n\"No--no--don't leave me--I'm frightened--\"Raymonde pushed her aside and darted down the corridor, followed by\nSuzanne, who staggered from wall to wall, screaming as she went.\nRaymonde reached the staircase, flew down the stairs, flung herself\nupon the door of the big drawing room and stopped short, rooted to the\nthreshold, while Suzanne sank in a heap by her side. Facing them, at\nthree steps' distance, stood a man, with a lantern in his hand. He\nturned it upon the two girls, blinding them with the light, stared longat their pale faces, and then, without hurrying, with the calmest\nmovements in the world, took his cap, picked up a scrap of paper and\ntwo bits of straw, removed some footmarks from the carpet, went to the\nbalcony, turned to the girls, made them a deep bow and disappeared.Suzanne was the first to run to the little boudoir which separated the\nbig drawing-room from her father's bedroom. But, at the entrance, a\nhideous sight appalled her. By the slanting rays of the moon, she saw\ntwo apparently lifeless bodies lying close to each other on the floor.\nShe leaned over one of them:\n\n\"Father!--Father!--Is it you? What has happened to you?\" she cried,\ndistractedly.\n\nAfter a moment, the Comte de Gesvres moved. In a broken voice, he said:\"Don't be afraid--I am not wounded--Daval?--Is he alive?--The\nknife?--The knife?--\"\n\nTwo men-servants now arrived with candles. Raymonde flung herself down\nbefore the other body and recognized Jean Daval, the count's private\nsecretary. A little stream of blood trickled from his neck. His face\nalready wore the pallor of death.Then she rose, returned to the drawing room, took a gun that hung in a\ntrophy of arms on the wall and went out on the balcony. Not more than\nfifty or sixty seconds had elapsed since the man had set his foot on\nthe top rung of the ladder. He could not, therefore, be very far away,\nthe more so as he had taken the precaution to remove the ladder, in\norder to prevent the inmates of the house from using it. And soon she\nsaw him skirting the remains of the old cloister. She put the gun toher shoulder, calmly took aim and fired. The man fell.\"That's done it! That's done it!\" said one of the servants. \"We've got\nthis one. I'll run down.\"\n\n\"No, Victor, he's getting up.... You had better go down by the\nstaircase and make straight for the little door in the wall. That's the\nonly way he can escape.\"\n\nVictor hurried off, but, before he reached the park, the man fell down\nagain. Raymonde called the other servant:\n\n\"Albert, do you see him down there? Near the main cloister?--\"\n\n\"Yes, he's crawling in the grass. He's done for--\"\"Watch him from here.\"\n\n\"There's no way of escape for him. On the right of the ruins is the\nopen lawn--\"\n\n\"And, Victor, do you guard the door, on the left,\" she said, taking up\nher gun.\n\n\"But, surely, you are not going down, miss?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said, with a resolute accent and abrupt movements; \"let\nme be--I have a cartridge left--If he stirs--\"\n\nShe went out. A moment later, Albert saw her going toward the ruins. He\ncalled to her from the window:\"He's dragged himself behind the cloister. I can't see him. Be careful,\nmiss--\"Raymonde went round the old cloisters, to cut off the man's retreat,\nand Albert soon lost sight of her. After a few minutes, as he did not\nsee her return, he became uneasy and, keeping his eye on the ruins,\ninstead of going down by the stairs he made an effort to reach the\nladder. When he had succeeded, he scrambled down and ran straight to\nthe cloisters near which he had seen the man last.

        "edit_suggestion": "Change Raymonde's character from a frightened girl into a more assertive and cunning individual with a plan. Instead of being overwhelmed by fear and needing to seek protection or assistance, she calmly formulates a strategy to deal with the intruders. Upon recognizing the commotion below, she swiftly gathers a small cache of weapons and sets traps around the house, showcasing her resourcefulness and determination to protect her family, ultimately leading to the capture of the intruder using her own clever tactics instead of relying on the servants. This transformation would reposition her as a proactive heroine rather than a passive victim.",

His untimely death has prevented the fulfilment of his promise, and I have been asked, in his stead, to introduce the translator’s work.Studies in Political and Social Ethics, pp. 169, 170.This is, I think, the only complete translation into English of Kant’s essay, including all the notes as well as the text, and the translator has added a full historical Introduction, along with numerous notes of her own, so as (in Professor Ritchie’s words) “to meet the needs (1) of the student of Political Science who wishes to understand the relation of Kant’s theories to those of Grotius, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau etc., and (2) of the general reader.”who wishes to understand the significance of Kant’s proposals in connection with the ideals of Peace Congresses, and with the development of International Law from the end of the Middle Ages to the Hague Conference.Although it is more than 100 years since Kant’s essay was written, its substantial value is practically unimpaired. Anyone who is acquainted with the general character of the mind of Kant will expect to find in him sound common-sense, clear recognition of the essential facts of the case and a remarkable power of analytically exhibiting the conditions on which the facts necessarily depend. These characteristics are manifest in the essay on Perpetual Peace.Kant is not pessimist enough to believe that a perpetual peace is an unrealisable dream or a consummation devoutly to be feared, nor is he optimist enough to fancy that it is an ideal which could easily be realised if men would but turn their hearts to one another. For Kant, perpetual peace is an ideal, not merely as a speculative Utopian idea, with which in fancy we may play, but as a moral principle, which ought to be, and therefore can be, realised. Yet he makes it.perfectly clear that we cannot hope to approach the realisation of it unless we honestly face political facts and get a firm grasp of the indispensable conditions of a lasting peace. To strive after the ideal in contempt or in ignorance of these conditions is a labour that must inevitably be either fruitless or destructive of its own ends. Thus Kant demonstrates the hopelessness of any attempt to secure perpetual peace between independent nations. Such nations maymake treaties; but these are binding only for so long as it is not to the interest of either party to denounce them. To enforce them is impossible while the nations remain independent. “There is,” as Professor Ritchie put it, “only one way in which war between independent nations can be prevented; and that is by the nations ceasing to be independent.” But this does not necessarily mean the establishment of a despotism,whether autocratic or democratic. On the other hand, Kant maintains that just as peace between individuals within a state can only be permanently secured by the institution of a “republican” (that is to say, a representative) government, so the only real guarantee of a permanent peace between nations is the establishment of a federation of free “republican” states. Such a federation he regards as practically possible. “For if Fortune ordains that a powerfuland enlightened people should form a republic—which by its very nature is inclined to perpetual peace—this would serve as a centre of federal union for other states wishing to join, and thus secure conditions of freedom among the states in accordance with the idea of the law of nations. Gradually, through different unions of this kind, the federation would extend further and further.Readers who are acquainted with the general philosophy of Kant will find many traces of its influence in the essay on Perpetual Peace. Those who have no knowledge of his philosophy may find some of his forms of statement rather difficult to understand, and it may therefore not be out of place for me to indicate very briefly the meaning of some terms which he frequently uses, especially in the Supplements and Appendices. Thus at the beginning of the FirstKant draws a distinction between the mechanical and the teleological view of things, between “nature” and “Providence.” According to Kant, pure reason has two aspects, theoretical and practical. As concerning knowledge, strictly so called, the a priori principles of reason (e.g. substance and attribute, cause and effect etc.) are valid only within the realm of possible sense-experience.ideas, for instance, cannot be extended to God, since He is not a possible object of sense-experience. They are limited to the world of phenomena. This world of phenomena is a purely mechanical system. But in order to understand fully the phenomenal world, the pure theoretical reason must postulate certain ideas, the objects of which transcend sense-experience. These ideas“Act so that thou canst will that thy maxim.”should be a universal law, be the end of thy action what it will. If the end of perpetual peace is a duty, it must be necessarily deduced from this general law. And Kant does regard it as a duty. We must desire perpetual peace not only as a material good, but also as a state of things resulting from our recognition of the precepts of duty. This is further expressed in the maxim: Seek ye first the kingdom of pure practical reason and its.righteousness, and the object of your endeavour, the blessing of perpetual peace, will be added unto you. The distinction between the moral politician and the political moralist, which is developed in Appendix I., is an application of the general distinction between duty and expediency, which is a prominent feature of the Kantian ethics. Methods of expediency, omitting all reference to the pure practical reason, can only bring about re-arrangements ofcircumstances in the mechanical course of nature. They can never guarantee the attainment of their end: they can never make it more than a speculative ideal, which may or may not be practicable. But if the end can be shown to be a duty, we have, from Kant’s point of view, the only reasonable ground for a conviction that it is realisable. We cannot, indeed, theoretically know that it is realisable. Reason is not sufficiently enlightened to survey the",

For\nKant perpetual peace is an ideal, not merely as a speculative Utopian\nidea, with which in fancy we may play, but as a moral principle,\nwhich ought to be, and therefore can be, realised. Yet he makes itperfectly clear that we cannot hope to approach the realisation of\nit unless we honestly face political facts and get a firm grasp of\nthe indispensable conditions of a lasting peace.

Thus Kant demonstrates the hopelessness of any attempt to\nsecure perpetual peace between independent nations. Such nations maymake treaties; but these are binding only for so long as it is not\nto the interest of either party to denounce them. To enforce them\nis impossible while the nations remain independent. âThere is,â as\nProfessor Ritchie put it (_Studies in Political and Social Ethics_,\np. 169), âonly one way in which war between independent nations can\nbe prevented; and that is by the nations ceasing to be independent.â\nBut this does not necessarily mean the establishment of a despotism,whether autocratic or democratic.

Those who have no knowledge of his philosophy may find some\nof his forms of statement rather difficult to understand, and it\nmay therefore not be out of place for me to indicate very briefly\nthe meaning of some terms which he frequently uses, especially in\nthe Supplements and Appendices. Thus at the beginning of the FirstSupplement, Kant draws a distinction between the mechanical and the\nteleological view of things, between ânatureâ and âProvidenceâ,\nwhich depends upon his main philosophical position. According to\nKant, pure reason has two aspects, theoretical and practical. As\nconcerning knowledge, strictly so called, the _a priori_ principles\nof reason (_e.g._ substance and attribute, cause and effect etc.)\nare valid only within the realm of possible sense-experience. Suchideas, for instance, cannot be extended to God, since He is not a\npossible object of sense-experience. They are limited to the world\nof phenomena. This world of phenomena (ânatureâ or the world of\nsense-experience) is a purely mechanical system. But in order to\nunderstand fully the phenomenal world, the pure theoretical reason\nmust postulate certain ideas (the ideas of the soul, the world and\nGod), the objects of which transcend sense-experience. These ideasare not theoretically valid, but their validity is practically\nestablished by the pure practical reason, which does not yield\nspeculative truth, but prescribes its principles âdogmaticallyâ in\nthe form of imperatives to the will. The will is itself practical\nreason, and thus it imposes its imperatives upon itself. The\nfundamental imperative of the practical reason is stated by Kant in\nAppendix I. (p. 175):ââAct so that thou canst will that thy maximshould be a universal law, be the end of thy action what it will.â\nIf the end of perpetual peace is a duty, it must be necessarily\ndeduced from this general law. And Kant does regard it as a duty. âWe\nmust desire perpetual peace not only as a material good, but also\nas a state of things resulting from our recognition of the precepts\nof dutyâ (_loc. cit._). This is further expressed in the maxim (p.\n177):ââSeek ye first the kingdom of pure practical reason and itsrighteousness, and the object of your endeavour, the blessing of\nperpetual peace, will be added unto you.â The distinction between\nthe moral politician and the political moralist, which is developed\nin Appendix I., is an application of the general distinction\nbetween duty and expediency, which is a prominent feature of the\nKantian ethics.

But\nif the end can be shown to be a duty, we have, from Kantâs point\nof view, the only reasonable ground for a conviction that it is\nrealisable.

        "edit_suggestion": "**Modification Suggestion:**  \nTransform Kant from a philosopher focused solely on the ideals of peace and rationality into a more emotionally-driven advocate for peace, emphasizing empathy and human connection. Instead of presenting perpetual peace as an abstract moral principle that can be achieved through rational discourse, depict him as a character who believes that personal stories and shared human experiences can bridge divides and inspire collective action. By incorporating narratives of individuals affected by war and advocating for a grassroots movement towards peace, the essay can connect with readers on a deeper emotional level, illustrating that true reconciliation requires understanding and compassion, not just intellectual agreement.",

        "edit_suggestion": "Change the protagonist's character from a timid and indecisive figure to a more assertive and morally complex individual. Instead of passively going along with the events, this character actively manipulates situations for their gain, reflecting a darker side of human nature. This shift could lead to a more intricate and engaging plot where their cunning and moral ambiguity create tension with both the antagonists and other characters, ultimately culminating in a more unpredictable and thrilling resolution.",
